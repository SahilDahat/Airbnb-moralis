# AIRBNB 
This Airbnb clone is made with Moralis, Moralis-v1, web3uikit. It is made with using React, and Solidity is used for transacting in Crypto. The changes in Moralis caused the application to be incomplete as the new version does not support some of the older functionalitites. This project can be changed into a new project and any help will be deeply appreciated. 

# Airbnb-Starter

# Use npm i -g npm-check-updates npm then use ncu -u 

This project was made and inspired by the Moralis tutorial (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj-Mb-xz1Os). The final finished project would have looked like this (https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/youtube-tutorials/tree/main/AirBNB_Decentral) made by Moralis team. 

# Using Yarn - yarn run , yarn build
